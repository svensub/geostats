## Geostatistical Modelling

The repository contains code used for a project that employed geospatial methods to spatially predict treatment-priority areas for river-blindness in Tanzania. The data used for this project was obtained from Rapid Epidemiological Mapping of Onchocerciasis (REMO) data for Tanzania; the data contains patient information and cannot be made publically available but this code can be used with other spatial datasets. The primary package used in this project was the PrevMap R package (https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v078.i08), which implements the fitting of geostatistical models for binomial data. The commented code used for the analysis can be found under the main_code.R document.
